                I was a Technical intern at The Aerospace Corporation in the Visualization and Immersive Technologies Department during the summer of 2019. I built responsive full stack web apps using technologies such as React, Redux, and MongoDB. I also worked on a team to design and build a web application for voice and text communication using WebRTC by following the engineering design process from user interviews to a final prototype.

               My project partner and I used Matlab to experiment with three different methods of classifying movie posters based off genre, specifically differentiating between Romance and Science Fiction movie posters. Our methods included simple cutoff based off average brightness of the image, using and Eigenfaces approach on an image matrix including color, and using linear regression on an image matrix including color.

              My project partner and I designed a customizable interface for interactive art in pygame, where the user moves their mouse to draw shapes. The user can choose between several different types of shapes (circles, squares, triangles, bowties, hexagons), and different color palettes. The user can also change the size of the shapes, mirror their drawing, or animate the shapes to make them fall, scroll, scatter, or bounce. Click to see our github repository.

              I worked in a group of three to make an Electromyogram for the Olin First-Year class Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement. An electromyogram (EMG) is a device that measures electrical muscle activity. Our EMG consisted of a circuit to amplify and filter the signal from three electrodes placed on the skin.

                I used Javascript to make a program that makes a gradient website background based on the website visitor’s time of day. You can see the demonstration on this web page right now. Or click to see the code that makes it happen.

                  I was the lighting director for my college’s Fall production of “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder” and Spring production of "Almost Maine." I designed the light cues in the weeks leading up to the show, and then programmed the light board during tech week, and ran the light board during rehearsals and the performances.
